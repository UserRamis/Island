# The "islands" project with changeable parameters, consisting of an array of locations (the user chooses the size of the island himself). The locations will be filled with vegetation and animals. Animals can:
eat plants and/or other animals (if there is suitable food in their location),
move (to neighboring locations),
reproduce (if there is a pair in their location),
starve to death or be eaten.
At the end of the game we have a list of surviving animals
